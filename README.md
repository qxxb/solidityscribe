# SolidityScribe

**SolidityScribe** is a development tool designed to enhance the smart contract development lifecycle by providing static analysis, testing preparation, and improvement suggestions using **EtherOps**.

## Features

- Fetch and analyze smart contract source code.
- Static code analysis with Solhint.
- Contract testing preparation with Truffle.

## Installation

```bash
npm install solidityscribe

```

## Usage
First, ensure EtherOps is configured correctly. Then, use SolidityScribe to analyze and prepare your contract:
```bash
const SolidityScribe = require('solidityscribe');
const scribe = new SolidityScribe();

scribe.improveContract('<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>');

```
SolidityScribe assists in identifying potential improvements and preparing your contract for a robust development process.
